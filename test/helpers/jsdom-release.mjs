// test/helpers/jsdom-release.mjs
// Release a jsdom window's memory after its test, for suites that boot the real
// app.js once per test.
//
// Those suites import app.js under a fresh `?b=<random>` URL per test so its
// top-level state starts clean. Node never unloads an ES module, so every
// instance stays in the module map for the life of the process, and its
// top-level bindings (cached elements like `nodesGroupBox`) keep that test's
// whole DOM reachable. window.close() stops the window's timers but cannot cut
// that path. A file with ~100 such tests grew past Node's 4GB heap on CI and
// aborted, even though every test passed.
//
// releaseDom() detaches every element from its parent and drops its attributes,
// so a leaked module pins only the few elements it named, not the document
// behind them. It measured a 57% lower heap at the end of
// test/ui-history-detail.test.mjs. The module's own code and state still leak;
// keep files that boot app.js per test from growing without bound.
//
// app.js's bare setTimeout/setInterval are Node's timers, not the window's, so
// close() does not stop them. A guide's poll interval kept the process alive,
// and a live view's exit timeout fired into the released DOM after its test.
// useDomRelease() clears the intervals started while a tracked window was open.
// Timeouts end on their own and some free app.js state when they fire (clearing
// them measured 40% more heap), so they still run; an error one throws after
// its window was released is swallowed, since only the teardown caused it.
