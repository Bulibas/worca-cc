// Where a hosted Worca may browse and pick server folders. In remote mode with the
// terminal and actions off, a signed-in person must not be able to list (or register,
// or install into) any folder on the server: the folder browser and the routes that
// take a folder path are limited to Worca's own folders — the data dir (the Worca home)
// and the projects root. Containment is checked on REAL paths (symlinks and `..`
// resolved), so a link inside an allowed folder cannot lead out of it. Below a root, a
// hidden folder (a name starting with a dot: .ssh, .config, .git) counts as outside,
// and a root that is the filesystem root or a one-segment folder (/home, /usr, C:\Users)
// is never accepted, whatever the configuration falls back to.
// Pure besides fs reads; the server decides when the limit applies (ui/server.mjs).
