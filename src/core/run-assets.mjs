// Declared-asset resolution and run-folder staging.
//
// Worca CC agents may declare `requiresAssets: string[]` in their meta sidecar:
// folders shipped with worca under `assets/<name>/` that the agent needs as
// plain files. Skills mount into a worktree's `.claude/skills` because that is
// the only path the headless `claude -p` child scans; an asset is not a skill —
// it is data the agent reads or copies — so it is staged into the RUN FOLDER,
// the one directory every agent can reach on both detached and legacy runs and
// the one resume preserves.
//
// This exists because the deck kit had no staging at all: the builder prompt
// said "cp from the project checkout", the kit ships inside worca rather than
// the user's project, and a run whose project was an unrelated repo only found
// it because the agent globbed the filesystem under permissive guardrails.
//
//   - isValidAssetName()      pure: the path-segment guard (skills.mjs S2 standard)
//   - collectRequiredAssets() pure: union of requiresAssets across the plan's agents
//   - stageAssets()           side-effect: copy assets/<name>/ into the run folder

 * without a plugin layer here a plugin-shipped agent declaring one failed the
 * whole run at setup with no way to satisfy it. worca's own asset wins, so a
 * plugin cannot shadow a kit worca ships.
 *
 * Throws on an invalid or missing asset rather than staging a partial set: an
 * agent whose kit is half-present fails later, deeper, and less legibly than one
 * that never started. Overwrites on resume — the shipped asset is canonical, and
